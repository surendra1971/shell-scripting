$ git add fileName  or   git add .              ; git will start tracking all the changes that you made 
$ git commit -m "Brief message of your changes" ; commit means, you're telling git to COMMIT/SAVE it ; you can only push the changes that are commited.
$ git push                                      ; pushes the changes that you've made to gitHub 
$ git pull                                      ; be in the folder repository, this will pull all the changes
